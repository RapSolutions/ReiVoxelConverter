ReiVoxelConverter
=================

This Simple Java Application converts Waypoints from:
Rei's Minimap Waypoints
   into
VoxelMap Waypoints

Simply point to your Minecraft Game Directory and press convert

- Rei Minimap: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-162-jul08-reis-minimap-v34-01/
               (for 1.7.2 - http://www.games-utilities.com/reis-minimap-mod-minecraft-1-4-4/)
- Voxel Map: http://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/zans-minimap/

This is just a simple basis setup in about one hour, so don't expect the world ;-)
But feel free to fork and help extend this converter.

Hopefully this will prevent you from spending hours converting Waypoints by hand.
